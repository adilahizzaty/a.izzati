Hi! My name is Nur Adilah Izzati binti Ahamad Damari @ Damahuri.
I am a science library student. I am also the youngest child in my family.
I have two older brothers and two older sisters. My mum is a full time 
housewife and my dad is a government pensioner.

It is a common knowledge that I am a good student and hardworking.
My favorite subjects are related to arts but I'm also struggling with my 
current field. I’m what a lot of people call a geek. I have intention of 
continue studying to a reputable university and obtaining a master in these
fields. I am responsible and have strong spirit, so I study hard to obtain 
good grades.

I have always been treated like a baby, by my parents and siblings. Despite 
that, sometimes my friends talk to me like I am a mature woman, which is 
why I basically a good observer. Being a good observer let people learn and 
live in this hard world in the calmly mode.

This is not to say that I don’t love all the care and attention.
I do, it’s just that sometimes it can get stifling. 
However, I am quite content with my life.

I started school at Tadika Abim, Tanjung Malim, when I was six years old.
The location is only 5 kilometres from my house. Even so, I didn't enjoy going
to school at first. This was because I was a shy person who found it difficult
to make friends at the time. I had only one good friend at the time. In short, 
I didn't enjoy my kindergarten, and I have forgotten the majority of my memories
from that time. Despite that, I eventually finished kindergarten, albeit reluctantly.

best friend. We go to the same school but in different classes. I had to make new 
friends because we were in different classes. My life in primary school was not 
particularly interesting because I still struggled to get along with others during 
the first five years. However, this is not an excuse for me to fail in my studies. 
Despite the fact that my exam results are not stellar, I tried to study. In my 
final year, I began to adapt well and make friends, and finally, for the big exam 
for students in primary school, I received 3B and 2C on the UPSR exam.</font></pre></td>

activities. For the red sports house team, I am a long jumper and runner. 
I'm a member of the KRS and hold the Corporal. High school experiences and 
memories are extremely satisfying. My life transformed from shy and quiet

curious about my sister's personality, and most teachers agree that STPM 
students have more mature personalities. That's the reason my struggled continued 
at the STPM level. Despite the fact that it was extremely difficult lik hell, I 
eventually made it.</font></pre></td>
